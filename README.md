# 🎯 Number Guessing Game (Python)

## 📌 Project Description
The **Number Guessing Game** is a simple Python console-based application where the program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**, and the user attempts to guess the number within a limited number of attempts. The program provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is **too high or too low**.

This project was developed as part of **Level 1 – Task 2** during my internship training to strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Generate a random number using Python’s `random` module
- Allow the user multiple attempts to guess the number
- Provide feedback such as **Too High** or **Too Low**
- End the game when the number is guessed correctly or attempts are exhausted

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Random Module
- Control Structures (if-else)
- Loops (while loop)
